      Welcome to VarCI @{{ user.login }}!

      Continue pushing changes to the config in this branch and I'll validate the changes.

      You can also test out new rules in your pull requests before merging them.

      For example, try triggering the second rule by mentioning me (@VarCIBot) right now!

  respond_to_me:

    name: Respond to me when I comment mentioning @VarCIBot
    events: [ issue_comment ]
    when:
      - action = "created"
      - user.login = "boneskull"
      - body contains "@VarCIBot"
    comment: |
      Perfect @{{ user.login }} - now replace the first two rules with your own!

      If you wish to keep the third rule, you can merge by starting a comment with "LGTM".

      Please see the following resources if you get stuck - best of luck!
