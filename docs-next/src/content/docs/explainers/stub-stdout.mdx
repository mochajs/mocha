description: Learn how to properly stub stdout for testing console output
title: "Stubbing stdout"
---

If you want to stub `stdout` inside your own code (via `process.stdout.write` or `console.log`) there is a potential to hinder Mocha's reporter output. This is because they rely on the same mechanisms to print results of the tests.

i.e.

```javascript
it('should do, but it do not', function() {
  // user wants to hide output generated by console.log calls in fn 'foo'
  console.log = function() {};
  foo();

  expect(...)
});
```

This will result in a faulty reporter output.

The correct way to handle this is to stub before and restore after the function call.

```javascript
it('will do', function() {
  var consoleLogStub = sinon.stub(console, 'log');
  foo();
  consoleLogStub.restore();

  expect(...)
});
```

Now the reporters can run and print the assertion without any interference, while stubbing `stdout` inside your function.
