title: Test Duration

Many reporters will display test duration and flag tests that are slow (default: 75ms), as shown here with the SPEC reporter:

![test duration](./reporter-spec-duration.png)

There are three levels of test duration (depicted in the following image):

1. FAST: Tests that run within half of the "slow" threshold will show the duration in green (if at all).
2. NORMAL: Tests that run exceeding half of the threshold (but still within it) will show the duration in yellow.
3. SLOW: Tests that run exceeding the threshold will show the duration in red.

To tweak what's considered "slow", you can use the `slow()` method:

```js
describe("something slow", function () {
  this.slow(300000); // five minutes

  it("should take long enough for me to go make a sandwich", function () {
    // ...
  });
});
```
