title: Node.js Native ESM Support
---

:::note[New in v7.1.0]
:::

Mocha supports writing your tests as ES modules, and not just using CommonJS.
For example:

```js
// test.mjs
import { add } from "./add.mjs";
import assert from "assert";

it("should add to numbers from an es module", () => {
  assert.equal(add(3, 5), 8);
});
```

To enable this you don't need to do anything special.
Write your test file as an ES module.
In Node.js this means either ending the file with a `.mjs` extension, or, if you want to use the regular `.js` extension, by adding `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`.
More information can be found in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).

### Current Limitations

- [Watch mode](/next/running/cli#--watch--w) does not support ES Module test files
- [Custom reporters](/next/reporters/third-party) and [custom interfaces](/next/interfaces/third-party) can only be CommonJS files
- [Configuration file](/next/running/configuring) can only be a CommonJS file (`.mocharc.js` or `.mocharc.cjs`)
- Mocha in Node.js version 24.4.0 or older [silently ignored top level errors in ESM files](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/5396).
  If you cannot upgrade to a newer Node.js version, you can add `--no-experimental-require-module` to the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable.
- When using module-level mocks via libs like `proxyquire`, `rewiremock` or `rewire`, hold off on using ES modules for your test files.
  You can switch to using `testdouble`, which does support ESM.
