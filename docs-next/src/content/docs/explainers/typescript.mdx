import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

Mocha supports TypeScript out of the box using [Node.js type stripping](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html#type-stripping). Type stripping was added in Node 22.6.0 via the `--experimental-strip-types` flag and became default behavior in Node 22.12.0. Type stripping is [stable as of November 2025](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v25.2.0). Type-stripping was backported to Node 20.19.0 as default behavior.

## Quick Start

Install Mocha, Mocha's types, and Node types:

<PackageManagers dev type="add" pkg="mocha @types/mocha @types/node" />

Create a test file:

```typescript
// example.test.ts
import * as assert from "node:assert";

describe("Array", function () {
  it("should return -1 when value is not present", function () {
    assert.equal([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
  });
});
```

:::note
At this point, your IDE may complain "Cannot find name 'describe'" or "Cannot find module 'node:assert' or its corresponding type declarations". This shouldn't stop the tests from working. For details, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
:::

Run your tests:

```bash
npx mocha example.test.ts

# Older versions of Node require an experimental flag
npx mocha --experimental-strip-types example.test.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

In case of IDE issues not finding types, you can optionally add an empty `tsconfig.json` at the root of your project:

```js
// tsconfig.json
{
}
```

Upon restarting your IDE, any type errors should go away.
