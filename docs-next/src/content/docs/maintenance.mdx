- **Relationship**: The OpenJS Foundation's Cross-Project Council (CPC) delegates technical leadership to Mocha's maintainers
- **Requirements**: Changes to the project charter, Code of Conduct, and licenses must be ratified by the CPC

#### Key Governance Documents

- **Maintainer Guidelines**: [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)

- **Licenses**:
  - Code: [MIT License](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/main/LICENSE)
  - Documentation: [CC-BY-4.0](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/main/docs/LICENSE-CC-BY-4.0)

### Maintainer Team

Current maintainers and their roles are documented in [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

- **View Team**: [github.com/orgs/mochajs/people](https://github.com/orgs/mochajs/people)
- **Decision Making**: Loose consensus-seeking process (described in MAINTAINERS.md)

## Access & Permissions

### Who Has Access

Access to various services is limited to maintainers and administrators:

- **GitHub Repository**: Maintainers have write access
- **npm Publishing**: Automated via OIDC (no individual access needed)
- **Netlify**: Admin access for deploy configuration
- **Open Collective**: Admin access for financial management
- **Domain DNS**: Admin access for domain configuration

### Requesting Access

Contributors who need access to services should:

1. Become a recognized contributor first (multiple merged PRs)
2. Contact an [existing maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/mochajs/people)
3. Discuss the need for access and responsibilities

### Security Contacts

For security issues, see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Administrative Tasks

### Release Management

Mocha uses automated release management via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
- **Process**: 
  1. Release-please tracks changes via conventional commits
  2. Opens a release PR when ready
  3. Merging the PR triggers automatic npm publish
  4. CHANGELOG is updated automatically

### Documentation Updates

Documentation is updated through:

- **Manual PRs**: Contributors submit changes to `docs-next/src/content/docs/`
- **Nightly Deploy**: Automated workflow updates supporter list daily
- **Deploy Previews**: Every PR with doc changes gets a Netlify preview

### Supporter List Updates

The supporter list on the homepage is updated automatically:

- **Frequency**: Nightly (via `.github/workflows/nightly-site-deploy.yml`)
- **Source**: Fetches from Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors
- **Mechanism**: Netlify webhook triggered by GitHub Actions

### Issue & PR Automation

The `octoguide` workflow provides automated issue and PR management:

- **Labeling**: Automatic labels based on content
- **Triage**: Helps maintainers categorize and prioritize
- **Configuration**: `.github/workflows/octoguide.yml`

## Costs & Payments

### What We Pay For
