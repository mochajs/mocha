:::note[New Site Preview]
Hello!
Welcome to this preview of a revamped **mochajs.org** docs site!

This is an early stage WIP preview.
If you see any **bugs** or **typos** _that aren't on [mochajs.org](https://mochajs.org)_, please mention them on [docs: add new website using Astro Starlight](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/5246).
Thanks!

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and in the browser, making asynchronous testing _straightforward_ and _fun_.
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
