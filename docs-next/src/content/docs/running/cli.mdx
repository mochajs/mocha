## Rules & Behavior

### `--allow-uncaught`

By default, Mocha will attempt to trap uncaught exceptions thrown from running tests and report these as test failures.
Use `--allow-uncaught` to disable this behavior and allow uncaught exceptions to propagate.
Will typically cause the process to crash.

This flag is useful when debugging particularly difficult-to-track exceptions.

### `--async-only, -A`

Enforce a rule that tests must be written in "async" style, meaning each test provides a `done` callback or returns a `Promise`.
Non-compliant tests will be marked as failures.

### `--bail, -b`

Causes Mocha to stop running tests after the first test failure it encounters.
Corresponding "after each" and "after all" hooks are executed for potential cleanup.

`--bail` does _not_ imply `--exit`.

### `--check-leaks`

Use this option to have Mocha check for global variables that are leaked while running tests.
Specify globals that are acceptable via the `--global` option (for example: `--check-leaks --global jQuery --global MyLib`).

### `--compilers`

:::note
`--compilers` was removed in v6.0.0.
See [further explanation and workarounds](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/compilers-deprecation).
:::

### `--delay`

Delay initial execution of root suite.

See [Delayed Root Suite](../features/hooks#delayed-root-suite).

### `--dry-run`

:::note[New in v9.0.0]
:::

Report tests without executing any of them, neither tests nor hooks.

### `--exit`

:::note[Updated in v4.0.0]
TL;DR: If your tests hang after an upgrade to Mocha v4.0.0 or newer, use `--exit` for a quick (though not necessarily recommended) fix.
:::

_Prior to_ version v4.0.0, _by default_, Mocha would force its own process to exit once it was finished executing all tests.
This behavior enables a set of potential problems; it's indicative of tests (or fixtures, harnesses, code under test, etc.) which don't clean up after themselves properly.
Ultimately, "dirty" tests can (but not always) lead to _false positive_ or _false negative_ results.

"Hanging" most often manifests itself if a server is still listening on a port, or a socket is still open, etc.
It can also be something like a runaway `setInterval()`, or even an errant `Promise` that never fulfilled.

The _default behavior_ in v4.0.0 (and newer) is `--no-exit`, where previously it was `--exit`.

**The easiest way to "fix" the issue is to pass `--exit` to the Mocha process.**
It _can_ be time-consuming to debug &mdash; because it's not always obvious where the problem is &mdash; but it _is_ recommended to do so.

To ensure your tests aren't leaving messes around, here are some ideas to get started:

- See the [Node.js guide to debugging](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector)
- Use the new [`async_hooks`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/api/async_hooks.md) API ([example](https://gist.github.com/boneskull/7fe75b63d613fa940db7ec990a5f5843))
- Try something like [wtfnode](https://npm.im/wtfnode)
- Use [`.only`](../declaring/exclusive-tests) until you find the test that causes Mocha to hang

### `--pass-on-failing-test-suite`

:::note[New in v10.7.0]
:::

If set to `true`, Mocha returns exit code `0` even if there are failed tests during the run.

### `--fail-zero`

:::note[New in v9.1.0]
:::

Fail test run if no tests are encountered with `exit-code: 1`.

### `--forbid-only`

Enforce a rule that tests may not be exclusive (use of e.g., `describe.only()` or `it.only()` is disallowed).

`--forbid-only` causes Mocha to fail when an exclusive ("only'd") test or suite is encountered, and it will abort further test execution.

### `--forbid-pending`

Enforce a rule that tests may not be skipped (use of e.g., `describe.skip()`, `it.skip()`, or `this.skip()` anywhere is disallowed).

`--forbid-pending` causes Mocha to fail when a skipped ("pending") test or suite is encountered, and it will abort further test execution.

### `--global <variable-name>`

:::note[Updated in v6.0.0]
The option is `--global` and `--globals` is now an alias.
:::

Define a global variable name.
For example, suppose your app deliberately exposes a global named `app` and `YUI`, you may want to add `--global app --global YUI`.

`--global` accepts wildcards.
You could do `--global '*bar'` and it would match `foobar`, `barbar`, etc.
You can also pass in `'*'` to ignore all globals.

`--global` can accept a comma-delimited list; `--global app,YUI` is equivalent to `--global app --global YUI`.

By using this option in conjunction with `--check-leaks`, you can specify an allowlist of known global variables that you _expect_ to leak into global scope.

### `--jobs <count>, -j <count>`

:::note[New in v8.0.0]
:::

Use `--jobs <count>` to specify the _maximum_ number of processes in the worker pool.

The default value is the _number of CPU cores_ less 1.

:::tip
Use `--jobs 0` or `--jobs 1` to temporarily disable `--parallel`.
:::

Has no effect unless used with [`--parallel`](#--parallel--p).

### `--parallel, -p`

:::note[New in v8.0.0]
:::

Use the `--parallel` flag to run tests in a worker pool.

Each test file will be put into a queue and executed as workers become available.

:::caution
`--parallel` has certain implications for Mocha's behavior which you must be aware of.
Read more about [running tests in parallel](../features/parallel-mode).
:::

### `--retries <n>`

Retries failed tests `n` times.

Mocha does not retry test failures by default.

### `--slow <ms>, -s <ms>`

Specify the "slow" test threshold in milliseconds.
Mocha uses this to highlight test cases that are taking too long.
"Slow" tests are not considered failures.

:::note
A test that executes for _half_ of the "slow" time will be highlighted _in yellow_ with the default `spec` reporter; a test that executes for entire "slow" time will be highlighted _in red_.
:::

### `--timeout <ms>, -t <ms>`

:::note[Updated in v6.0.0]
`--timeout 0` is implied when invoking Mocha using inspect flags.
`--timeout 99999999` is no longer needed.
:::

Specifies the test case timeout, defaulting to two (2) seconds (2000 milliseconds).
Tests taking longer than this amount of time will be marked as failed.

To override you may pass the timeout in milliseconds, or a value with the `s` suffix, e.g., `--timeout 2s` and `--timeout 2000` are equivalent.

To disable timeouts, use `--timeout 0`.

:::note
Synchronous (blocking) tests are also bound by the timeout, but they will not complete until the code stops blocking.
Infinite loops will still be infinite loops!
:::

### `--ui <name>, -u <name>`

The `--ui` option lets you specify the interface to use, defaulting to `bdd`.

## Reporting & Output

### `--color, -c, --colors`

:::note[Updated in v6.0.0]
`--colors` is now an alias for `--color`.
:::

"Force" color output to be enabled, or alternatively force it to be disabled via `--no-color`.
By default, Mocha uses the [supports-color](https://npm.im/supports-color) module to decide.

In some cases, color output will be explicitly suppressed by certain reporters outputting in a machine-readable format.

### `--diff`

When possible, show the difference between expected and actual values when an assertion failure is encountered.

This flag is unusual in that it **defaults to `true`**; use `--no-diff` to suppress Mocha's own diff output.

Some assertion libraries will supply their own diffs, in which case Mocha's will not be used, regardless of the default value.

Mocha's own diff output does not conform to any known standards, and is designed to be human-readable.

:::note[New in v9.2.1]
:::

By default strings are truncated to 8192 characters before generating a diff.
This is to prevent performance problems with large strings.

It can however make the output harder to interpret when comparing large strings.
Therefore it is possible to configure this value using `--reporter-option maxDiffSize=[number]`.

A value of 0 indicates no limit, default is 8192 characters.

### `--full-trace`

Enable "full" stack traces.
By default, Mocha attempts to distill stack traces into less noisy (though still useful) output.

This flag is helpful when debugging a suspected issue within Mocha or Node.js itself.

### `--inline-diffs`

Enable "inline" diffs, an alternative output for diffing strings.

Useful when working with large strings.

Does nothing if an assertion library supplies its own diff output.

### `--reporter <name>, -R <name>`

Specify the reporter that will be used, defaulting to `spec`.

Allows use of third-party reporters.
For example, [mocha-lcov-reporter](https://npm.im/mocha-lcov-reporter) may be used with `--reporter mocha-lcov-reporter` after it has been installed.

### `--reporter-option <option>, -O <option>, --reporter-options <option>`

:::note[Updated in v6.0.0]
Can be specified multiple times.
`--reporter-options` is now an alias for `--reporter-option`.
:::

Provide options specific to a reporter in `<key>=<value>` format, e.g., `--reporter tap --reporter-option tapVersion=13`.

Not all reporters accept options.

Can be specified as a comma-delimited list.

## Configuration

### `--config <path>`

:::note[New in v6.0.0]
:::

Specify an explicit path to a [configuration file](./configuring).

By default, Mocha will search for a config file if `--config` is not specified; use `--no-config` to suppress this behavior.

### `--node-option <name>, -n <name>`

:::note[New in v9.1.0]
:::

For Node.js and V8 options.
Mocha forwards these options to Node.js by spawning a new child-process.

The options are set without leading dashes `--`, e.g. `-n require=foo -n unhandled-rejections=strict`

Can also be specified as a comma-delimited list: `-n require=foo,unhandled-rejections=strict`

### `--opts <path>`

:::note[Removed in v8.0.0]
Please use [configuration file](./configuring) instead.
:::

### `--package <path>`

:::note[New in v6.0.0]
:::

Specify an explicit path to a [`package.json` file](./configuring) (ostensibly containing configuration in a `mocha` property).

By default, Mocha looks for a `package.json` in the current working directory or nearest ancestor, and will use the first file found (regardless of whether it contains a `mocha` property); to suppress `package.json` lookup, use `--no-package`.

## File Handling

### `--extension <ext>`

Files having this extension will be considered test files.
Defaults to `js`.

Specifying `--extension` will _remove_ `.js` as a test file extension; use `--extension js` to re-add it.
For example, to load `.mjs` and `.js` test files, you must supply `--extension mjs --extension js`.

The option can be given multiple times.
The option accepts a comma-delimited list: `--extension a,b` is equivalent to `--extension a --extension b`.

:::note[New in v8.2.0]
:::

`--extension` now supports multipart extensions (e.g., `spec.js`), leading dots (`.js`) and combinations thereof (`.spec.js`);

### `--file <file>`

:::caution
`--file` is incompatible with [parallel mode](../features/parallel-mode).
:::

Explicitly _include_ a test file to be loaded before other test files.
Multiple uses of `--file` are allowed, and will be loaded in order given.

Useful if you want to declare, for example, hooks to be run before every test across all other test files.

Files specified this way are not affected by `--sort` or `--recursive`.

Files specified in this way should contain one or more suites, tests or hooks.
If this is not the case, consider `--require` instead.

### `--ignore <file|directory|glob>, --exclude <file|directory|glob>,`

Explicitly ignore one or more test files, directories or globs (e.g., `some/**/files*`) that would otherwise be loaded.

Can be specified multiple times.

:::note[New in v10.0.0]
In Windows always use forward-slashes `/` as path separator.
:::

Files specified using `--file` _are not affected_ by this option.

### `--recursive`

When looking for test files, recurse into subdirectories.

See `--extension` for defining which files are considered test files.

### `--require <module>, -r <module>`

Require a module before loading the user interface or test files.
This is useful for:

- Test harnesses
- Assertion libraries that augment built-ins or global scope (such as [should.js](https://npm.im/should))
- Compilers such as Babel via [@babel/register](https://npm.im/@babel/register) or TypeScript via [ts-node](https://npm.im/ts-node) (using `--require ts-node/register`).
  See [Babel](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha-examples/tree/main/packages/babel) or [TypeScript](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha-examples/tree/main/packages/typescript) working examples.

Modules required in this manner are expected to do work synchronously; Mocha won't wait for async tasks in a required module to finish.

:::caution
**You cannot use `--require` to set hooks**.
If you want to set hooks to run, e.g., before each test, use a [Root Hook Plugin](../features/root-hook-plugins).
:::

:::note
As of v8.0.0, Mocha supports `--require` for [NodeJS native ESM](../explainers/nodejs-native-esm-support).
There is no separate `--import` flag.
:::

### `--sort, -S`

:::caution
`--sort` is incompatible with [parallel mode](../features/parallel-mode).
:::

Sort test files (by absolute path) using [Array.prototype.sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort).

### `--watch, -w`

Rerun tests on file changes.

The `--watch-files` and `--watch-ignore` options can be used to control which files are watched for changes.

Tests may be rerun manually by typing &#x24e1; &#x24e2; &#x23ce; (same shortcut as `nodemon`).

### `--watch-files <file|directory|glob>`

:::note[New in v7.0.0]
:::

List of paths or globs to watch when `--watch` is set.
If a file matching the given glob changes or is added or removed mocha will rerun all tests.

If the path is a directory all files and subdirectories will be watched.

By default all files in the current directory having one of the extensions provided by `--extension` and not contained in the `node_modules` or `.git` folders are watched.

The option can be given multiple times.
The option accepts a comma-delimited list: `--watch-files a,b` is equivalent to `--watch-files a --watch-files b`.

### `--watch-ignore <file|directory|glob>`

:::note[New in v7.0.0]
:::

List of paths or globs to exclude from watching.
Defaults to `node_modules` and `.git`.

To exclude all files in a directory it is preferable to use `foo/bar` instead of `foo/bar/**/*`.
The latter will still watch the directory `foo/bar` but will ignore all changes to the content of that directory.

The option can be given multiple times.
The option accepts a comma-delimited list: `--watch-ignore a,b` is equivalent to `--watch-ignore a --watch-ignore b`.

## Test Filters

### `--fgrep <string>, -f <string>`

:::caution[Breaking change in v6.0.0]
Now mutually exclusive with `--grep`.
:::

Cause Mocha to only run tests having titles containing the given `string`.

Mutually exclusive with `--grep`.

### `--grep <regexp>, -g <regexp>`

:::caution[Breaking change in v6.0.0]
Now mutually exclusive with `--fgrep`.
:::

Cause Mocha to only run tests matching the given `regexp`, which is internally compiled to a [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Regexp).

Suppose, for example, you have "api" related tests, as well as "app" related tests, as shown in the following snippet; One could use `--grep api` or `--grep app` to run one or the other.
The same goes for any other part of a suite or test-case title, `--grep users` would be valid as well, or even `--grep GET`.

And another option with double quotes: `--grep "groupA|groupB"`.

And for more complex criteria: `--grep "/get/i"`.
Some shells as e.g. Git-Bash-for-Windows may require: `--grep "'/get/i'"`.
Using flags other than the `ignoreCase /i` (especially `/g` and `/y`) may lead to unpredictable results.

```js
describe("api", function () {
  describe("GET /api/users groupA", function () {
    it("respond with an array of users", function () {
      // ...
    });
  });
});

describe("app", function () {
  describe("GET /users groupB", function () {
    it("respond with an array of users", function () {
      // ...
    });
  });
});
```

Mutually exclusive with `--fgrep`.

### `--invert`

Use the _inverse_ of the match specified by `--grep` or `fgrep`.

Requires either `--grep` or `--fgrep` (but not both).

## Other Options

### `--inspect, --inspect-brk, inspect`

Enables Node.js' inspector.

Use `--inspect` / `--inspect-brk` to launch the V8 inspector for use with Chrome Dev Tools.

Use `inspect` to launch Node.js' internal debugger.

All of these options are mutually exclusive.

Implies `--timeout 0`.

Each flag annotated of type `[boolean]` in Mocha's `--help` output can be _negated_ by prepending `--no-` to the flag name.
For example, `--no-color` will disable Mocha's color output, which is enabled by default.

Unless otherwise noted, _all_ boolean flags default to `false`.

## About `node` Flags

The `mocha` executable supports all applicable flags which the `node` executable supports.

These flags vary depending on your version of Node.js.

`node` flags can be defined in Mocha's [configuration](./configuring).

:::note[New in v9.1.0]
You can also pass `node` flags to Node.js using [`--node-option`](#--node-option-name--n-name).

### `--enable-source-maps`

:::note[New in vNode.js v12.12.0]
:::

If the [`--enable-source-maps`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/cli.html#cli_enable_source_maps) flag
is passed to Mocha, source maps will be collected and used to provide accurate stack traces for transpiled code:

```bash
Error: cool
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/fake-user/bigco/nodejs-tasks/build/src/index.js:27:7)
        -> /Users/fake-user/bigco/nodejs-tasks/src/index.ts:24:7
```

## About V8 Flags

Prepend `--v8-` to any flag listed in the output of `node --v8-options` (excluding `--v8-options` itself) to use it.

V8 flags can be defined in Mocha's [configuration](./configuring).

:::note[New in v9.1.0]
You can also pass V8 flags (without `--v8-`) to Node.js using [`--node-option`](#--node-option-name--n-name).
