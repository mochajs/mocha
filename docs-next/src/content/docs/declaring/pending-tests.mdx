title: Pending Tests
---

"Pending" — as in "someone should write these test cases eventually" — test-cases are those _without_ a callback:

```js
describe("Array", function () {
  describe("#indexOf()", function () {
    // pending test below
    it("should return -1 when the value is not present");
  });
});
```

Pending tests will be included in the test results, and marked as pending.
A pending test is not considered a failed test.

Read the [inclusive tests section](./inclusive-tests) for an example of conditionally marking a test as pending via `this.skip()`.
