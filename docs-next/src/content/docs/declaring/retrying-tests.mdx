title: Retry Tests
---

You can choose to retry failed tests up to a certain number of times.
This feature is designed to handle end-to-end tests (functional tests/Selenium...) where resources cannot be easily mocked/stubbed.
**It's not recommended to use this feature for unit tests**.

This feature does re-run a failed test and its corresponding `beforeEach/afterEach` hooks, but not `before/after` hooks.
`this.retries()` has no effect on failing hooks.

:::note
Example below was written using Selenium webdriver (which [overwrites global Mocha hooks](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/c10e8a955883f004452cdde18096d70738397788/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/testing/index.js) for `Promise` chain).
:::

```js
describe("retries", function () {
  // Retry all tests in this suite up to 4 times
  this.retries(4);

  beforeEach(function () {
    browser.get("http://www.yahoo.com");
  });

  it("should succeed by the 3rd try", function () {
    // Specify this test to only retry up to 2 times
    this.retries(2);
    expect($(".foo").isDisplayed()).to.eventually.be.true;
  });
});
```
