title: Global Fixtures
---

:::note[New in v8.2.0]
:::

At first glance, _global fixtures_ seem similar to [root hook plugins](./root-hook-plugins).
However, unlike root hooks, global fixtures:

1. Are _guaranteed_ to execute _once and only once_
1. Work identically parallel mode, watch mode, and serial mode
1. Do not share a context with tests, suites, or other hooks

There are two types of global fixtures: [global setup fixtures](#global-setup-fixtures) and [global teardown fixtures](#global-teardown-fixtures).

## Global Setup Fixtures

To create a global setup fixture, export `mochaGlobalSetup` from a script, e.g.,:

```js
// fixtures.cjs

// can be async or not
exports.mochaGlobalSetup = async function () {
  this.server = await startSomeServer({ port: process.env.TEST_PORT });
  console.log(`server running on port ${this.server.port}`);
};
```

...or an ES module:

```js
// fixtures.mjs

// can be async or not
export async function mochaGlobalSetup() {
  this.server = await startSomeServer({ port: process.env.TEST_PORT });
  console.log(`server running on port ${this.server.port}`);
}
```

To use it, load this file when running Mocha via `mocha --require fixtures.cjs` (or whatever you have named the file).

:::tip
Remember: you can define "requires" in a [configuration file](../running/configuring).
:::

Now, before Mocha loads and runs your tests, it will execute the above global setup fixture, starting a server for testing.
This won't shut _down_ the server when Mocha is done, however!
To do that, use a _[global teardown fixture](#global-teardown-fixtures)_.

## Global Teardown Fixtures

Just like a [global setup fixture](#global-setup-fixtures), a _global teardown fixture_ can be created by exporting from a "required" script (we can put both types of fixtures in a single file):

```js
// fixtures.cjs, cont'd

// can be async or not
exports.mochaGlobalTeardown = async function () {
  await this.server.stop();
  console.log("server stopped!");
};
```

...or an ES module:

```js
// fixtures.mjs, cont'd

// can be async or not
export async function mochaGlobalTeardown() {
  await this.server.stop();
  console.log("server stopped!");
}
```

You'll note that we used `this` in the fixture examples.
Global setup fixtures and global teardown fixtures _share a context_, which means we can add properties to the context object (`this`) in the setup fixture, and reference them later in the teardown fixture.
This is more useful when the fixtures are in separate files, since you can just use JS' variable scoping rules instead ([example below](#when-not-to-use-global-fixtures)).

As explained [above](#_top)--and [below](#when-not-to-use-global-fixtures)--test files _do not_ have access to this context object.

## When To Use Global Fixtures

Global fixtures are good for spinning up a server, opening a socket, or otherwise creating a resource that your tests will repeatedly access via I/O.

## When Not To Use Global Fixtures

If you need to access an in-memory value (such as a file handle or database connection), _don't_ use global fixtures to do this, because your tests will not have access to the value.

:::note
You could be clever and try to get around this restriction by assigning something to the `global` object, but this will _not_ work in parallel mode.
It's probably best to play by the rules!
:::

Instead, use the global fixture to _start_ the database, and use [root hook plugins](./root-hook-plugins) or plain old [hooks](./hooks) to create a connection.

Here's an example of using global fixtures and "before all" hooks to get the job done.
Note that we do not reference the `server` object anywhere in our tests!

First, use a global fixture to start and stop a test server:

```js
// fixtures.mjs

let server;

export const mochaGlobalSetup = async () => {
  server = await startSomeServer({ port: process.env.TEST_PORT });
  console.log(`server running on port ${server.port}`);
};

export const mochaGlobalTeardown = async () => {
  await server.stop();
  console.log("server stopped!");
};
```

Then, connect to the server in your tests:

```js
// test.spec.mjs

import { connect } from "my-server-connector-thingy";

describe("my API", function () {
  let connection;

  before(async function () {
    connection = await connect({ port: process.env.TEST_PORT });
  });

  it("should be a nice API", function () {
    // assertions here
  });

  after(async function () {
    return connection.close();
  });
});
```

Finally, use this command to bring it together: `mocha --require fixtures.mjs test.spec.mjs`.
