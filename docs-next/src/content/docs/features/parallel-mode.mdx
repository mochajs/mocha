:::note[New in v8.0.0]
:::

Depending on the number and nature of your tests, you may find a significant performance benefit when running tests in parallel (using the [`--parallel`](../running/cli#--parallel--p) flag).

Parallel tests should work out-of-the box for many use cases.
However, you must be aware of some important implications of the behavior.

Authors of third-party libraries built on Mocha should read this!

## Reporter Limitations

Due to the nature of the following reporters, they cannot work when running tests in parallel:

- [`json-stream`](../reporters/json-stream)
- [`markdown`](../reporters/markdown)
- [`progress`](../reporters/progress)

These reporters expect Mocha to know _how many tests it plans to run_ before execution.
This information is unavailable in parallel mode, as test files are loaded only when they are about to be run.

In serial mode, tests results will "stream" as they occur.
In parallel mode, reporter output is _buffered_; reporting will occur after each file is completed.
In practice, the reporter output will appear in "chunks" (but will otherwise be identical).
If a test file is particularly slow, there may be a significant pause while it's running.

## Exclusive Tests are Disallowed

**You cannot use `it.only`, `describe.only`, `this.only()`, etc., in parallel mode.**
This is for the same reason as the incompatible reporters noted above: in parallel mode, Mocha does not load all files and suites into memory before running tests.

Suggested workarounds:

1. Use [`--grep`](../running/cli#--grep-regexp--g-regexp) or [`--fgrep`](../running/cli#--fgrep-string--f-string) instead; it's not particularly efficient, but it will work.
1. Don't use parallel mode.
   Likely, you won't be running very many exclusive tests, so you won't see a great benefit from parallel mode anyhow.

:::tip
If parallel mode is defined in your config file, you can temporarily disable it on the command-line by using either the `--no-parallel` flag or reducing the job count, e.g., `--jobs=0`.
:::

## File Order is Non-Deterministic

In parallel mode, Mocha does not guarantee the order in which test files will run, nor which worker process runs them.

Because of this, the following options, which depend on order, _cannot be used_ in parallel mode:

- [`--file`](../running/cli#--file-file)
- [`--sort`](../running/cli#--sort--s)
- [`--delay`](../running/cli#--delay)

## Test Duration Variability

Running tests in parallel mode will naturally use more system resources.
The OS may take extra time to schedule and complete some operations, depending on system load.
For this reason, the timeouts of _individual tests_ may need to be increased either [globally](../running/cli#--timeout-ms--t-ms) or [otherwise](./timeouts).

## "Bail" is "Best Effort"

When used with `--bail` (or `this.bail()`) to exit after the first failure, it's likely other tests will be running at the same time.
Mocha must shut down its worker processes before exiting.

Likewise, subprocesses may throw uncaught exceptions.
When used with `--allow-uncaught`, Mocha will "bubble" this exception to the main process, but still must shut down its processes.

Either way, Mocha will abort the test run "very soon."

## Root Hooks Are Not Global

:::note
This only applies when running in parallel mode.
:::

A _root hook_ is a hook in a test file which is _not defined_ within a suite.
An example using the `bdd` interface:

```js
// test/setup.js

// root hook to run before every test (even in other files)
beforeEach(function () {
  doMySetup();
});

// root hook to run after every test (even in other files)
afterEach(function () {
  doMyTeardown();
});
```

When run (in the default "serial" mode) via this command:

```bash
mocha --file "./test/setup.js" "./test/**/*.spec.js"
```

`setup.js` will be executed _first_, and install the two hooks shown above for every test found in `./test/**/*.spec.js`.

**The above example does not work in parallel mode.**

When Mocha runs in parallel mode, **test files do not share the same process,** nor do they share the same instance of Mocha.
Consequently, a hypothetical root hook defined in test file _A_ **will not be present** in test file _B_.

Here are a couple suggested workarounds:

1. `require('./setup.js')` or `import './setup.js'` at the top of every test file.
   Best avoided for those averse to boilerplate.
1. _Recommended_: Define root hooks in a "required" file, using the new (also as
   of v8.0.0) [Root Hook Plugin](./root-hook-plugins) system.

If you need to run some code _once and only once_, use a [global fixture](./global-fixtures) instead.

## No Browser Support

Parallel mode is only available in Node.js, for now.

## Limited Reporter API for Third-Party Reporters

Third-party reporters may encounter issues when attempting to access non-existent properties within `Test`, `Suite`, and `Hook` objects.
If a third-party reporter does not work in parallel mode (but otherwise works in serial mode), please [file an issue](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/new).

## Troubleshooting Parallel Mode

If you find your tests don't work properly when run with [`--parallel`](../running/cli#--parallel--p), either shrug and move on, or use this handy-dandy checklist to get things working:

- ✅ Ensure you are using a [supported reporter](#reporter-limitations).
- ✅ Ensure you are not using [other unsupported flags](#file-order-is-non-deterministic).
- ✅ Double-check your [config file](../running/configuring); options set in config files will be merged with any command-line option.
- ✅ Look for root hooks (they look like [this](#root-hooks-are-not-global)) in your tests.
  Move them into a [Root Hook Plugin](./root-hook-plugins).
- ✅ Do any assertion, mock, or other test libraries you're consuming use root hooks? They may need to be [migrated](#migrating-a-library-to-use-root-hook-plugins) for compatibility with parallel mode.
- ✅ If tests are unexpectedly timing out, you may need to increase the default test timeout (via [`--timeout`](../running/cli#--timeout-ms--t-ms))
- ✅ Ensure your tests do not depend on being run in a specific order.
- ✅ Ensure your tests clean up after themselves; remove temp files, handles, sockets, etc.
  Don't try to share state or resources between test files.

## Caveats About Testing in Parallel

Some types of tests are _not_ so well-suited to run in parallel.
For example, extremely timing-sensitive tests, or tests which make I/O requests to a limited pool of resources (such as opening ports, or automating browser windows, hitting a test DB, or remote server, etc.).

Free-tier cloud CI services may not provide a suitable multi-core container or VM for their build agents.
Regarding expected performance gains in CI: your mileage may vary.
It may help to use a conditional in a `.mocharc.js` to check for `process.env.CI`, and adjust the job count as appropriate.

It's unlikely (but not impossible) to see a performance gain from a [job count](../running/cli#--jobs-count--j-count) _greater than_ the number of available CPU cores.
That said, _play around with the job count_--there's no one-size-fits all, and the unique characteristics of your tests will determine the optimal number of jobs; it may even be that fewer is faster!

## Parallel Mode Worker IDs

:::note[New in v9.2.0]
:::

Each process launched by parallel mode is assigned a unique id, from 0 for the first process to be launched, to N-1 for the Nth process.
This worker id may be accessed in tests via the environment variable `MOCHA_WORKER_ID`.
It can be used for example to assign a different database, service port, etc for each test process.
