title: Root Hook Plugins
---

:::note[New in v8.0.0]
:::

In some cases, you may want a [hook](./hooks) before (or after) every test in every file.
These are called _root hooks_.
Previous to v8.0.0, the way to accomplish this was to use `--file` combined with root hooks (see _[Root Hooks Are Not Global](./parallel-mode#root-hooks-are-not-global)_).
This still works in v8.0.0, but _not_ when running tests in parallel mode!
For that reason, running root hooks using this method is _strongly discouraged_, and may be deprecated in the future.

A _Root Hook Plugin_ is a JavaScript file loaded via [`--require`](../running/cli#--require-module--r-module) which "registers" one or more root hooks to be used across all test files.

In browsers you can set root hooks directly via a `rootHooks` object: `mocha.setup({ rootHooks: {beforeEach() {...}} })`, see [`mocha.setup()`](../running/browsers)

## Defining a Root Hook Plugin

A Root Hook Plugin file is a script which exports (via `module.exports`) a `mochaHooks` property.
It is loaded via `--require <file>`.

Here's a simple example which defines a root hook, written using CJS and ESM syntax.

### With CommonJS

```js
// test/hooks.js

exports.mochaHooks = {
  beforeEach(done) {
    // do something before every test
    done();
  },
};
```

### With ES Modules

We're using the `.mjs` extension in these examples.

:::tip
If you're having trouble getting ES modules to work, refer to [the Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).
:::

```js
// test/hooks.mjs

export const mochaHooks = {
  beforeEach(done) {
    // do something before every test
    done();
  },
};
```

:::note
Further examples will use ESM syntax.

## Available Root Hooks

Root hooks work with any interface, but _the property names do not change_.
In other words, if you are using the `tdd` interface, `suiteSetup` maps to `beforeAll`, and `setup` maps to `beforeEach`.

Available root hooks and their behavior:

- `beforeAll`:
  - In **serial** mode (Mocha's default), _before all tests begin, once only_
  - In **parallel** mode, run _before all tests begin, for each file_
- `beforeEach`:
  - In **both** modes, run _before each test_
- `afterAll`:
  - In **serial** mode, run _after all tests end, once only_
  - In **parallel** mode, run _after all tests end, for each file_
- `afterEach`:
  - In **both** modes, run _after every test_

:::tip
If you need to ensure code runs once and only once in any mode, use [global fixtures](./global-fixtures).
:::

As with other hooks, `this` refers to the current context object:

```js
// test/hooks.mjs

export const mochaHooks = {
  beforeAll() {
    // skip all tests for bob
    if (require("os").userInfo().username === "bob") {
      return this.skip();
    }
  },
};
```

## Multiple Root Hooks in a Single Plugin

Multiple root hooks can be defined in a single plugin, for organizational purposes.
For example:

```js
// test/hooks.mjs

export const mochaHooks = {
  beforeEach: [
    function (done) {
      // do something before every test,
      // then run the next hook in this array
    },
    async function () {
      // async or Promise-returning functions allowed
    },
  ],
};
```

## Root Hook Plugins Can Export a Function

If you need to perform some logic--such as choosing a root hook conditionally, based on the environment--`mochaHooks` can be a _function_ which returns the expected object.

```js
// test/hooks.mjs

export const mochaHooks = () => {
  if (process.env.CI) {
    // root hooks object
    return {
      beforeEach: [
        function () {
          // CI-specific beforeEach
        },
        function () {
          // some other CI-specific beforeEach
        },
      ],
    };
  }
  // root hooks object
  return {
    beforeEach() {
      // regular beforeEach
    },
  };
};
```

If you need to perform an async operation, `mochaHooks` can be `Promise`-returning:

```js
// test/hooks.mjs

export const mochaHooks = async () => {
  const result = await checkSomething();
  // only use a root hook if `result` is truthy
  if (result) {
    // root hooks object
    return {
      beforeEach() {
        // something
      },
    };
  }
};
```

## Multiple Root Hook Plugins

Multiple root hook plugins can be registered by using `--require` multiple times.
For example, to register the root hooks in `hooks-a.js` and `hooks-b.js`, use `--require hooks-a.js --require hooks-b.js`.
These will be registered (and run) _in order_.

## Migrating Tests to use Root Hook Plugins

To migrate your tests using root hooks to a root hook plugin:

1. Find your root hooks (hooks defined _outside_ of a suite--usually `describe()` callback).
1. Create a new file, e.g., `test/hooks.js`.
1. _Move_ your root hooks into `test/hooks.js`.
1. In `test/hooks.js`, make your hooks a member of an exported `mochaHooks` property.
1. Use `--require test/hooks.js` (even better: use a [config file](../running/configuring) with `{"require": "test/hooks.js"}`) when running your tests.

For example, given the following file, `test/test.spec.js`, containing root hooks:

```js
// test/test.spec.js

beforeEach(function () {
  // global setup for all tests
});

after(function () {
  // one-time final cleanup
});

describe("my test suite", function () {
  it("should have run my global setup", function () {
    // make assertion
  });
});
```

Your `test/hooks.js` (for this example, a CJS module) should contain:

```js
// test/hooks.js

exports.mochaHooks = {
  beforeEach: function () {
    // global setup for all tests
  },
  afterAll: function () {
    // one-time final cleanup
  },
};
```

:::note
Careful!
`after` becomes `afterAll` and `before` becomes `beforeAll`.
:::

Your original `test/test.spec.js` should now contain:

```js
// test/test.spec.js

describe("my test suite", function () {
  it("should have run my global setup", function () {
    // make assertion
  });
});
```

Running `mocha --require test/hooks.js test/test.spec.js` will run as before (and is now ready to be used with [`--parallel`](../running/cli#--parallel--p)).

## Migrating a Library to use Root Hook PLugins

If you're a library maintainer, and your library uses root hooks, you can migrate by refactoring your entry point:

- Your library should _always_ export a [`mochaHooks` object](#defining-a-root-hook-plugin).
- To maintain backwards compatibility, run your root hooks _if and only if_ `global.beforeEach` (or other relevant hook) exists.
- Instruct your users to `--require <your-package>` when running `mocha`.
