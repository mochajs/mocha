## Development

You might want to know that:

- Mocha is the _most-depended-upon_ module on npm (source: [libraries.io](https://libraries.io/search?order=desc&platforms=NPM&sort=dependents_count)), and
- Mocha is an _independent_ open-source project, maintained exclusively by volunteers.

You might want to help:

- New to contributing to Mocha? Check out this list of [good first issues](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue)
- Mocha could use a hand with [these issues](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- The [maintainer's handbook](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) explains how things get done

Finally, come [chat with the maintainers](https://gitter.im/mochajs/contributors) on Gitter if you want to help with:

- Triaging issues, answering questions
- Review, merging, and closing pull requests
- Other project-maintenance-y things
