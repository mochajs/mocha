# 3.0.2 / 2016-08-08

## :bug: Bug Fix

- [#2417]: Fix execution of *deeply* nested `describe.only()` suites ([@not-an-aardvark])
- Remove references to `json-cov` and `html-cov` reporters in CLI ([@boneskull])

[#2424]: https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2424

# 3.0.1 / 2016-08-03

## :bug: Bug Fix

- [#2406]: Restore execution of nested `describe.only()` suites ([@not-an-aardvark])

[#2406]: https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2406
[@not-an-aardvark]: https://github.com/not-an-aardvark

# 3.0.0 / 2016-07-31

## :boom: Breaking Changes

- :warning: Due to the increasing difficulty of applying security patches made within its dependency tree, as well as looming incompatibilities with Node.js v7.0, **Mocha no longer supports Node.js v0.8**.
- :warning: **Mocha may no longer be installed by versions of `npm` less than `1.4.0`.**  Previously, this requirement only affected Mocha's development dependencies.  In short, this allows Mocha to depend on packages which have dependencies fixed to major versions (`^`).
- `.only()` is no longer "fuzzy", can be used multiple times, and generally just works like you think it should. :joy:
- To avoid common bugs, when a test injects a callback function (suggesting asynchronous execution), calls it, *and* returns a `Promise`, Mocha will now throw an exception:

  ```js
  const assert = require('assert');

  it('should complete this test', function (done) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve) {
      assert.ok(true);
      resolve();
    })
      .then(done);
  });
  ```

  The above test will fail with `Error: Resolution method is overspecified. Specify a callback *or* return a Promise; not both.`.
- When a test timeout value *greater than* `2147483648` is specified in any context (`--timeout`, `mocha.setup()`, per-suite, per-test, etc.), the timeout will be *disabled* and the test(s) will be allowed to run indefinitely.  This is equivalent to specifying a timeout value of `0`.  See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout#Maximum_delay_value) for reasoning.
- The `dot` reporter now uses more visually distinctive characters when indicating "pending" and "failed" tests.
- Mocha no longer supports [component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/component).
- The long-forsaken `HTMLCov` and `JSONCov` reporters--and any relationship to the "node-jscoverage" project--have been removed.
- `spec` reporter now omits leading carriage returns (`\r`) in non-TTY environment.

## :tada: Enhancements

- [#808]: Allow regular-expression-like strings in `--grep` and browser's `grep` querystring; enables flags such as `i` for case-insensitive matches and `u` for unicode. ([@a8m])
- [#2000]: Use distinctive characters in `dot` reporter; `,` will denote a "pending" test and `!` will denote a "failing" test. ([@elliottcable])
- [#1632]: Throw a useful exception when a suite or test lacks a title. ([@a8m])
- [#1481]: Better `.only()` behavior. ([@a8m])
- [#2334]: Allow `this.skip()` in async tests and hooks. ([@boneskull])
- [#1320]: Throw a useful exception when test resolution method is overspecified. ([@jugglinmike])
- [#2364]: Support `--preserve-symlinks`. ([@rosswarren])

## :bug: Bug Fixes

- [#2259]: Restore ES3 compatibility.  Specifically, support an environment lacking `Date.prototype.toISOString()`, `JSON`, or has a non-standard implementation of `JSON`. ([@ndhoule], [@boneskull])
- [#2286]: Fix `after()` failing to execute if test skipped using `this.skip()` in `beforeEach()`; no longer marks the entire suite as "pending". ([@dasilvacontin], [@boneskull])
- [#2208]: Fix function name display in `markdown` and `html` (browser) reporters. ([@ScottFreeCode])
- [#2299]: Fix progress bar in `html` (browser) reporter. ([@AviVahl])
- [#2307]: Fix `doc` reporter crashing when test fails. ([@jleyba])
- [#2323]: Ensure browser entry point (`browser-entry.js`) is published to npm (for use with bundlers).  ([@boneskull])
- [#2310]: Ensure custom reporter with an absolute path works in Windows. ([@silentcloud])
- [#2311]: Fix problem wherein calling `this.slow()` without a value would blast any previously set value. ([@boneskull])
- [#1813]: Ensure Mocha's own test suite will run in Windows. ([@tswaters], [@TimothyGu], [@boneskull])
- [#2317]: Ensure all interfaces are displayed in `--help` on CLI.  ([@ScottFreeCode])
- [#1644]: Don't exhibit undefined behavior when calling `this.timeout()` with very large values ([@callumacrae], [@boneskull])
- [#2361]: Don't truncate name of thrown anonymous exception. ([@boneskull])
- [#2367]: Fix invalid CSS. ([@bensontrent])
- [#2401]: Remove carriage return before each test line in spec reporter. ([@Munter])

## :nut_and_bolt: Other

- Upgrade production dependencies to address security advisories (and because now we can): `glob`, `commander`, `escape-string-regexp`,
and `supports-color`. ([@boneskull], [@RobLoach])
- Add Windows to CI. ([@boneskull], [@TimothyGu])
- Ensure appropriate `engines` field in `package.json`. ([@shinnn], [@boneskull])
- [#2348]: Upgrade ESLint to v2 ([@anthony-redfox])

# 2.5.0 / 2016-05-23

> This has been awhile coming!  We needed to feel confident that the next release wouldn't break browser compatibility (e.g. the last few patch releases).
>
> ### Browser Tests in CI
>
> We now run unit tests against PhantomJS v1.x and an assortment of browsers on [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com), including:
> - Internet Explorer v8.0
> - Chrome (latest)
> - Firefox (latest)
> - Safari (latest)
> - Microsoft Edge (latest)
>
> To accomplish this, we now run Mocha's unit tests (and a handful of integration tests) via [Karma](https://npmjs.com/package/karma) and a modified [karma-mocha](https://npmjs.com/package/karma-mocha).  Along the way, we had to solve issue [#880] (apologies to @mderijcke and @sukima who had PRs addressing this), as well as replace most usages of [should](https://npmjs.com/package/should) with [expect.js](https://npmjs.com/package/expect.js) for IE8.
>
> Going forward, when sending PRs, your code will *only* run against PhantomJS v1.x (and not hit SauceLabs) [because security](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#Security-Restrictions-when-testing-Pull-Requests).
>
> ### Node.js 6.x
> Node.js 6.x "just worked" before, but now it's in the CI matrix, so it's "officially" supported.  Mocha *still retains support* for Node.js 0.8.x.
>
> ### "Minor" Release
> You'll see mostly bug fixes below, but also a couple features--as such, it's a "minor" release.
>
> ### TYVM
>
> Thanks to everyone who contributed, and our fabulous [sponsors and backers](https://opencollective.com/mochajs)!
